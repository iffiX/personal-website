  We conducted research on inspecting the performance of a value-based
  statistical algorithm on a network where each agent pair plays an extension of
  the iterated prisoner’s dilemma game (IPD), which

  supports choosing and refusing partners, also known as IPD/CR. Here we show by multi-agent simulation

  that this simple statistical algorithm has comparable performance to other well-known strategies on IPD

  games such as tit-for-tat (TFT) and win-stay-lose-shift (Pavlov). We also add noise corruption to the

  network to simulate networks in real scenarios where agents may misunderstand the passed message,

  and we compare the robustness of several well-known IPD strategies as well as the proposed statistical

  algorithm
